# Helper Entities Configuration for Mopidy UI Templates
#
# This file contains example configuration for Home Assistant helper entities
# that are used by the Mopidy UI templates for user input.
#
# To use these helpers:
# 1. Copy the relevant helper definitions to your Home Assistant configuration.yaml
# 2. Or add them via the Home Assistant UI: Settings -> Devices & Services -> Helpers
# 3. Restart Home Assistant to activate the helpers
# 4. Update the template files to reference these helper entity IDs
#
# Note: Replace "mopidy" prefix with your preferred naming convention if desired

# Queue Management Helpers
# These helpers are used for queue position inputs (1-based positions)

input_number:
  # Source position for moving tracks (from_position)
  mopidy_queue_from_position:
    name: "Queue Source Position"
    min: 1
    max: 100  # Adjust based on typical queue size; templates will validate against actual queue_size
    step: 1
    mode: box
    unit_of_measurement: "position"

  # Destination position for moving tracks (to_position)
  mopidy_queue_to_position:
    name: "Queue Destination Position"
    min: 1
    max: 100  # Adjust based on typical queue size; templates will validate against actual queue_size
    step: 1
    mode: box
    unit_of_measurement: "position"

  # Position for removing tracks
  mopidy_queue_remove_position:
    name: "Queue Remove Position"
    min: 1
    max: 100  # Adjust based on typical queue size; templates will validate against actual queue_size
    step: 1
    mode: box
    unit_of_measurement: "position"

  # History index for playing from history (1-based, 1 = most recent)
  mopidy_history_index:
    name: "History Track Index"
    min: 1
    max: 20  # Default history limit is 20 tracks
    step: 1
    mode: box
    unit_of_measurement: "index"

# Filter Criteria Helpers
# These helpers are used for filter track operations (case-insensitive substring match)

input_text:
  # Artist filter for removing tracks
  mopidy_filter_artist:
    name: "Filter by Artist"
    max: 100
    initial: ""

  # Album filter for removing tracks
  mopidy_filter_album:
    name: "Filter by Album"
    max: 100
    initial: ""

  # Genre filter for removing tracks
  mopidy_filter_genre:
    name: "Filter by Genre"
    max: 50
    initial: ""

  # Track name filter for removing tracks
  mopidy_filter_track_name:
    name: "Filter by Track Name"
    max: 100
    initial: ""

  # Playlist name for creating new playlists
  mopidy_playlist_name:
    name: "Playlist Name"
    max: 200
    initial: ""

  # Playlist URI for save/delete operations
  mopidy_save_playlist_uri:
    name: "Playlist URI (Save)"
    max: 200
    initial: ""

  # Playlist URI for delete operations
  mopidy_delete_playlist_uri:
    name: "Playlist URI (Delete)"
    max: 200
    initial: ""

# Usage Notes:
#
# 1. Queue Position Helpers (input_number):
#    - Positions are 1-based (first track is position 1)
#    - Templates will validate positions against actual queue_size attribute
#    - Max values can be adjusted based on your typical queue sizes
#
# 2. Filter Criteria Helpers (input_text):
#    - All filters use case-insensitive substring matching
#    - Multiple criteria use AND logic (all must match)
#    - Empty fields are ignored (not used in filter)
#
# 3. History Index Helper (input_number):
#    - Index is 1-based (1 = most recently played track)
#    - Max value of 20 matches default history limit
#    - Adjust max if you change history limit in service calls
#
# 4. Playlist Name Helper (input_text):
#    - Used when creating new playlists from queue
#    - If playlist with same name exists, it will be overwritten
#    - Must be non-empty for create operation
#
# 5. Entity ID References in Templates:
#    - Templates reference these helpers using: states('input_number.mopidy_queue_from_position')
#    - Replace "mopidy" prefix in helper names if you use different naming
#    - Update template files to match your helper entity IDs
